## Signing Your Work 

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license. Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.
  
* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
        in the file; or
    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified

- Add third-party dependencies only when needed, and update [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES).
- Do not commit secrets, local `.env` files, generated snapshots, private certificates, or token caches.
