NemoClaw Community is a collection of examples that showcase NemoClaw blueprints for constrained, inspectable agent workflows.

NemoClaw is the blueprint layer for composing three things into a repeatable agent system:

- **Model** — the inference endpoint, model selection, and provider configuration the agent uses.
- **Harness** — the agent runtime, skills, bridges, state, and workflow-specific behavior.
- **OpenShell** — the sandbox, gateway, policy, provider, and networking substrate that runs the harness with explicit boundaries.

The examples in this repository demonstrate complete blueprint patterns: they show how a model is wired to a harness, how the harness is packaged with skills and integrations, and how OpenShell constrains and runs the resulting agent.

## Reference Examples

Some examples are included in this repository. Others currently live in [brevdev/nemoclaw-demos](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos) and are candidates for future consolidation here.

| Example | Description | Link |
| ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| Personal Community Sentiment Triage | Pairs a Hermes harness with an OpenShell sandbox and community-signal integrations across Slack, Outlook, live read-only GitHub REST, GitHub discussion mirrors, and NVIDIA forum mirrors. | [Guide](examples/personal-community-sentiment-triage/README.md) |
| Hermes Brev Launchable | Provides a notebook path from a fresh Brev CPU instance to a working NemoClaw-managed Hermes sandbox, including installation, onboarding, API verification, and terminal access. | [Guide](examples/hermes-launchable/README.md) |
| OpenClaw Omni Example | Sets up a NemoClaw sandbox with a Nemotron Omni vision sub-agent, including reference OpenClaw configuration, policy, agent instructions, and verification scripts. | [Guide](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos/blob/main/openclaw-omni-demo/README.md) |
| Hermes Omni Example | Builds a local multimodal Hermes agent that can inspect video, audio, images, and PDFs through Nemotron Omni while running inside an OpenShell-constrained sandbox. | [Guide](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos/blob/main/hermes-omni-demo/hermes-omni-guide.md) |
| Flight Tracking Example | Adds a live airspace console with real-time aircraft data, map controls, aviation overlays, and an agent skill that operates through host-side proxies. | [Guide](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos/blob/main/flight-tracking-demo/flight-tracking-guide.md) |
| Google Workspace Integration | Connects a NemoClaw agent to Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Contacts, and Tasks through a host-side credential flow and sandbox-deployed tools. | [Guide](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos/blob/main/google-workspace-demo/google-workspace-guide.md) |
| Planet Integration | Gives the agent read-only access to Planet imagery workflows, including catalog search, thumbnails, tasking estimates, pass availability, and account quota checks. | [Guide](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos/blob/main/planet-integration-demo/planet-integration-guide.md) |
| Wakeup Example | Adds a host-controlled schedule that wakes the sandboxed agent at fixed intervals to follow a task list without letting the agent control its own timer. | [Guide](https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-demos/blob/main/wakeup-demo/nemoclaw-wakeup-guide.md) |

## Getting Started

Choose an example from the table above and follow its guide. To run an example from this repository, clone the repo first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemoclaw-community.git
cd nemoclaw-community
```

For other examples, follow the linked guide in `brevdev/nemoclaw-demos`. Each example documents its own host requirements, credentials, setup steps, and OpenShell policy details.

## Requirements

- Linux host with Docker or a compatible container runtime
- OpenShell CLI and gateway
- Access to an OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint
- Optional integration credentials for Slack, Microsoft Graph/Outlook, GitHub live reads, and source ETL mirrors
