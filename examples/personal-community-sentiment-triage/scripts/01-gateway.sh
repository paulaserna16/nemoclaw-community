# Step 1 of 3: ensure the CLI is pointed at a running OpenShell gateway.
#
# OpenShell 0.37+ no longer starts gateways from the CLI. The expected flow is:
#   - install OpenShell with the package-managed installer, which starts the
#     local gateway service for you, or
#   - run the snap-managed gateway service
#   - register that local endpoint with `openshell gateway add`
#
# This script keeps the example aligned to that flow. It selects an existing
# registration when present, or registers the default local endpoint for the
# named gateway when the name is one of the documented install paths.
#
# Try after this script:
#   $ openshell gateway info

set -euo pipefail
