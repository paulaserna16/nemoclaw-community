# Opt-in flags (mutually exclusive):
#   --stop-host-services    also stop the extras stack (phoenix, token

#                            preserved.
#   --purge-host-services   also stop the extras stack AND remove its
#                            named volumes (token-cache,
#                            source-etls-postgres-data, github-etl-state).

  (no flag)                Delete sandbox and per-sandbox providers only.
                           Host services keep running.
  --stop-host-services     Also stop host services (volumes preserved).
  --purge-host-services    Also stop host services AND remove named volumes.
